## Tidy Evaluation

### I have a string that I want to use as a filter

```{r}

(filt_fld = "cyl")

mtcars %>%
  filter(!!filt_fld == 6)
```


### It needs to be converted to a symbol

```{r}

(filt_fld = "cyl")

(filt_fld_as_sym = sym(filt_fld))

mtcars %>%
  filter(!!filt_fld_as_sym == 6)
```

### Multiple strings to symbols

```{r}
ord_flds = c("carb", "hp")

ord_flds_as_sym = syms(ord_flds)

mtcars %>%
  arrange(!!!ord_flds_as_sym) %>%
  head(5)
  
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
y_var = "wt"

y_var_as_sym = sym(y_var)

mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = cyl, y = !!y_var_as_sym)) +
  geom_point()

```
